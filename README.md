# Password_Generator
The Password Generator is a Python program designed to create strong, random passwords to ensure the security of user accounts and sensitive information. The program generates a password based on user-defined criteria, such as the desired length and the inclusion of various character types like:
1. Uppercase letters (A-Z)
2. Lowercase letters (a-z)
3. Digits (0-9)
4. Special characters (!@#$%^&*() etc.)
   The program leverages Pythonâ€™s random and string modules to shuffle and select characters randomly, creating a highly unpredictable password.
   The user can specify the length of the password and customize its composition (e.g., choosing whether to include numbers or symbols), ensuring flexibility for different security needs.

Key Features:
1. Randomized Password Generation: Ensures each password is unique and secure.
2. Customizable Length: The user can define the length of the password.
3. Character Set Customization: Users can choose which character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) to include in their password.
4. Easy to Use: Simple interface and output for quick password creation.
   This tool is ideal for users who want to generate strong passwords for accounts or applications, improving their security posture by reducing the risk of weak or predictable passwords.
